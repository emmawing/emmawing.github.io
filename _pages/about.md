My name is Emma Wing. I am a graduate student at the University of Connecticut in the [Language & Cognition Division](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/) of the Department of Psychological Sciences, where I work with Whit Tabor and Gerry Altmann.

I study how our knowledge of language corresponds to our concepts when we comprehend language, and how this process relates to the objects and events we perceive and experience in the world. 

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/emmawing/emmawing.github.io/files/wing_cv2024.pdf) as of October 2024.

Research interests
------
I am interested in the mapping between linguistic and conceptual structures and the way this relates to visual perception. I draw in large part on insights from generative linguistics and research on the perception, recognition, and representation of objects and events. I am also interested in determining the right way to characterize compositionality in language, concept, and visual processing, and whether they share characteristics of compositionality. In my experiments, I use behavioral methods that integrate the use of linguistic and visual stimuli, such as sentence-picture priming and eye tracking in the Visual World. I am strongly committed to bridging and integrating across disciplinary divides, and I actively seek collaborators in this endeavor.
