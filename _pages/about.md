Bio
======
My name is Emma Wing. I am a graduate student at the University of Connecticut in the [Language & Cognition Division](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/) of the Department of Psychological Sciences, where I work with Whit Tabor and Gerry Altmann.

I am interested in how our concepts and our knowledge of language interact when we comprehend language, how we build complex concepts, and how language comprehension relates to the objects and events we perceive and experience. 

Here is a copy of my [CV]().
