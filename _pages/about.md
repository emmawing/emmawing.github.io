My name is Emma Wing. I am a graduate student at the University of Connecticut in the [Language & Cognition Division](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/) of the Department of Psychological Sciences, where I work with Whit Tabor and Gerry Altmann.

I am interested in how our concepts and our knowledge of language interact when we comprehend language, how we build complex concepts, and how language comprehension relates to the objects and events we perceive and experience. 

Here is my [CV]() as of October 2024. 

Research interests
------
I am interested in the mapping of linguistic and conceptual structures and the way these relate to visual perception. I draw in large part on insights from generative linguistics and research on the perception, recognition, and representation of objects and events. I am strongly committed to bridging and integrating across disciplinary divides.
