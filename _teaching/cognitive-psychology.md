PSYC2501. The biological organ that is the human brain supports all the extraordinary things our minds can do. This course introduces the foundations of mental phenomena by exploring key theories, concepts, and discoveries in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. As we delve into topics such as perception, memory, and reasoning, we’ll develop skills in scientific thinking, scientific communication, and the ability to test and refine models and theories through experimental research. We will also learn about the methods used to study the mind, including behavioral, neuroimaging, and clinical methods. Cognitive psychology is a highly interdisciplinary field, interacting with neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, biology, linguistics, physics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, sociology, medicine—the list goes on! For this reason, cognitive psychology depends upon diverse perspectives and relies on interdisciplinary communication. We will also practice interdisciplinary communication in this class: each of us brings a unique set of background knowledge, experiences, and perspectives that together will lead us to rich discussions and innovative ideas as we learn about the human mind.
